Programming Projects in C for [Operating Systems - K22 Course](https://www.alexdelis.eu/k22/). 

The projects use data structures implemented by me.

4 programming projects that test following skills:
- Clean and modular code organization and *fake* TTY-API delevopment.
- (UNIX) Process programming.
- (UNIX) IPC programming with unamed pipes and fifos.
- (UNIX) Semaphores and Shared Memory programming for IPC.
- (UNIX) Tool Development for linux (tested in ubuntu). Mock `cp` command with extra optimization using a look-up table.
